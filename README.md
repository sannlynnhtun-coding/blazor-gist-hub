# GistHub

GistHub is a Blazor WebAssembly progressive web app for discovering, creating, and organizing GitHub Gists. GitHub is the remote source for gist content, while IndexedDB provides an account-scoped local workspace for cached gists, bookmarks, ordering, and collection assignments.

## Overview

The app supports two complementary workflows:

- Explore public gists as a guest, filter them by language, inspect another user's public gists, and connect a GitHub account when an action requires authentication.
- Manage a personal gist library: create, edit, delete, import, clone, search, bookmark, reorder, and group gists into local collections.

Additional features include a curated SLH collection, Markdown and Mermaid rendering, syntax highlighting, a JSON parser, code-to-image export, light/dark themes, and an installable PWA shell. The Trending page is currently a placeholder.

## Application workflow

1. **Start** - `/` opens My Collection, showing bookmarked gists when bookmarks exist. Discovery is available at `/discovery`.
2. **Connect GitHub** - `/login` validates a Personal Access Token against GitHub's `/user` endpoint, then saves the named profile in browser IndexedDB.
3. **Build the local cache** - a new profile initially fetches full content for up to 30 gists. Later syncs from **My Gists** refresh the account's cached gists, re-parse tags from descriptions, and preserve local bookmarks, bookmark order, and collection assignments.
4. **Manage gists** - create, edit, delete, clone, or import JSON. These operations call the GitHub API and then update the local cache.
5. **Organize locally** - bookmarks and collections are stored in the browser. They are not written to GitHub or synchronized across browsers/devices.
6. **Resume** - on a later visit, the first saved profile is restored and its account-scoped cache is available immediately.

- Responsive UI, themes, sound controls, file blur, and PWA support

## Local YouTube downloader (Windows)

Double-click **Start-LocalDownloader.cmd** in the repository root. The launcher installs portable yt-dlp and FFmpeg tools into the ignored `.local-tools` folder, verifies their published SHA-256 checksums, publishes GistHub and its local ASP.NET Core service, and opens **http://localhost:5188/tools/youtube-downloader**. The first launch downloads the tools and takes longer. It requires the .NET 10 SDK, Node.js 22 or later, npm, and an internet connection.

You can also open **Tools → YouTube Downloader** in that local GistHub window. Paste a YouTube watch, Shorts, or youtu.be link, choose **Find downloads**, switch between Video and Audio, then download a listed format. Video-only streams are merged with compatible audio. Audio supports native M4A/WebM and MP3 conversion. The UI shows actual available formats; `≈` marks estimated sizes and unknown sizes remain unknown. Downloads can be cancelled. A completed file downloads automatically, with a **Save file again** fallback.

Keep the launcher running while using the tool. Closing it stops the service. The service listens only on IPv4 loopback port 5188 and accepts browser API writes only from its own origin. It does not connect the hosted website to your local machine. The local URL has its own browser storage: connect GitHub there to use your gist library, and transfer bookmarks with JSON backup/restore if needed.

Temporary files are stored under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GistHub\Downloader`. Completed files and previews expire after one hour and are cleaned up on subsequent inspect/download requests. Live/upcoming videos and playlists are not supported. Jobs time out after 30 minutes, and individual source downloads are limited to 2 GB. YouTube restrictions, unavailable media, or extractor changes can cause errors; they appear in the tool. Update the portable dependencies when needed:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/install-downloader-tools.ps1 -Update
```

For subsequent launches without rebuilding:

```powershell
.\Start-LocalDownloader.cmd -NoBuild
```

Downloader tests use deterministic child processes and do not require YouTube access:

```powershell
dotnet run --project GistHub.LocalDownloader.Tests
dotnet run --project GistHub.RegressionTests
```

## Tech stack

- .NET 10 and Blazor WebAssembly
- C# services for GitHub access, state, and browser storage
- IndexedDB through JavaScript interop
- Tailwind CSS 3 with Forms and Typography plugins
- Marked, Mermaid, and highlight.js for rich gist previews
- Vercel for static hosting and the production GitHub API rewrite

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK 10.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js 20](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- A GitHub Personal Access Token with permission to read and write gists for authenticated features

### Install and run

From the repository root:

```bash
npm install --prefix GistHub
dotnet run --project GistHub/GistHub.csproj
```

Open the local URL printed by `dotnet run`. The MSBuild project runs the minified Tailwind build automatically before each .NET build.

For UI work, run the CSS watcher and the .NET watcher in separate terminals:

```bash
npm --prefix GistHub run build:css
```

```bash
dotnet watch --project GistHub/GistHub.csproj run
```

## Development workflow

1. Install JavaScript dependencies with `npm install --prefix GistHub`.
2. Run the Tailwind and .NET watchers while editing Razor, C#, or CSS files.
3. Exercise both guest and authenticated paths. GitHub calls go directly to `https://api.github.com` in development.
4. Before opening a pull request, restore and build the same solution used by CI:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore GistHub.slnx
   dotnet build GistHub.slnx --configuration Release --no-restore
   ```

The solution does not currently include an automated .NET test project, so the Release build and focused browser checks are the primary verification steps.

## Authentication and local data

GistHub does not have its own backend or account system. The browser sends the saved token to GitHub through `GithubService`; in production, requests use the `/api/github` Vercel rewrite.

Profiles currently include the access token and are stored unencrypted in the browser's IndexedDB. Use the app only on a trusted device, grant the token only the permissions it needs, and revoke the token in GitHub if the device or browser profile is compromised. Signing out clears the in-memory session; deleting a saved profile removes that profile record, while previously cached account data may remain locally.

## CI and deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs for pull requests and pushes targeting `main` or `master`:

- Pull requests install dependencies, restore the solution, and run a Release build.
- Branch pushes also publish the Blazor app, copy the Vercel configuration into `publish_output/wwwroot`, and deploy that directory to production.

Deployment requires these repository secrets:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
